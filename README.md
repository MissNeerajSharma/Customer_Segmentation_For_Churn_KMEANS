# UnSupervised_Kmean_Customer_Segmentation
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of market planning, enabling companies to tailor their strategies to different customer groups based on shared characteristics. This repository contains code and resources for performing unsupervised customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Overview

This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on various features such as demographics, purchasing behavior, or usage patterns. By identifying these segments, businesses can better understand their customer base and target them with more personalized marketing campaigns, product offerings, and customer service initiatives.

## Key Features

- **K-Means Clustering**: Utilize the K-Means algorithm to partition customers into clusters based on similarity.
- **Feature Engineering**: Preprocess and engineer relevant features to enhance clustering performance.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the resulting clusters to gain insights into customer segments.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of clustering using metrics such as silhouette score or inertia.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your customer data, ensuring it contains relevant features for segmentation.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data by scaling features, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
3. **Clustering**: Apply the K-Means algorithm to cluster the preprocessed data into distinct groups.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the resulting clusters using plots or charts to interpret the segmentation.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the quality of clustering using appropriate metrics to assess the effectiveness of the segmentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive usage)
- Required Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

## Example

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')
# Perform feature engineering and preprocessing steps (scaling, encoding, etc.)

# Apply K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
kmeans.fit(data)

# Visualize clusters
plt.scatter(data['feature1'], data['feature2'], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
plt.show()
